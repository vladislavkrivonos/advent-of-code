# advent-of-code

## General Description
This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2025, split by folders for each day of the competition.

## How to Navigate
Each day's solutions are organized in separate folders (e.g., `day-one/`, `day-two/`). Inside each folder, you'll find:
- `main.js` - The primary solution implementation
- `main2.js` - An alternative or optimized solution
- `read.js` - Input reading functionality
- `input.txt` - Input file (not included in the repository, needs to be added by the user)

## How to Launch
To run the solutions, you need to:
1. Add your own `input.txt` file into each day's folder with your puzzle input
2. Navigate to the specific day's folder
3. Run the solution using Node.js with the command: `node main.js`

For example, to run the day-two solution:
```bash
cd day-two
node main.js
```
